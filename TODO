test: do not fail uni tests if cc is too low.

replace chan by Quant (N-component) and Reader (N-component), no chan1 etc.

replace Slice by Frame, contains 3D size, ncomp, time stamp

kernel wrappers: if async, the arguments might not survive an unfortunately timed GC! this is also a problem with mumax2. also they leak to heap. kernel launches seem not to overlap, so perhaps just use one stream and a global parameter buffer?

auto-generate wrapper funcs for cuda kernels. also get rid of ptx map.

fuse a standard micromag kernel for at least the local terms. uses inline functions. exchange adds to demag. extra pointers to output buffers , if not NULL, leak intermediate output.  To save memory.
